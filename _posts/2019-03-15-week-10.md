**Monday the 2019-03-04**

This day I met up with my ERFA groups to discuss different subjects including:

- JavaScript frameworks
- Databases
- Web development

Afterwards we had an hour or two about international module, where I will be going to Antwerp, Belgium for study trip.

Here we are going to have contact with different students and innovate on a subject chosen by the teachers. 

We will be exploring the Belgium cultures and Antwerp in general and visit a development company. 

**Tuesday the 2019-03-05 to Thursday the 2019-03-07**

I spend most of my time reading up on subjects and to be ready to implement my first service. This service should be ready next week. I also prepared a internship interview which I will be going to on Tuesday.

**Friday the 2019-03-08**

I met with my group where we discussed different things regarding our project. Our project meetings needed more structure and a better flow.
