I have had some hectic weeks. Starting of with a lot of internship interviews and struggle, to a one week study trip to Antwerp in Belgium. I have now finished the study trip and exam, and found an internship - YAY. 

The progress have pretty much stopped, but now we are back.

A lot of work has been done to my [RequestService](https://github.com/juli516b/Ordsome.Services.RequestService) after [Jesper](https://enmango.dk/), my group mate, helped me with some issues after using my API.

Now it's time to implemented some messaging and a new API controlling Users and authentication. 

In this week I will present the API and my thoughts about how I implemented it.

See you in the next post.
